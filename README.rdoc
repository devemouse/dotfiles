== Dariusz Synowiec HOME folder (aka dotfiles)

Those are my most important configuration files from HOME folder. 

Most important of all is .vimrc and whole vimfiles directory.
This git repository was create because of vim settings ;)

I will add more configuration files as soon as they will be ready to publish.

Hope you like it

Regards,
Darek

== Environment

I work on Windows and Linux environments. Those settings are shared between
those systems and work fine.
